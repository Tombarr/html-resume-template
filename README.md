# html-resume-template

Single-page resume template built using HTML, CSS, and JS that can be viewed on the web.
Based on [html-resume-template](https://github.com/Tombarr/html-resume-template), but functionality of editing the resume from UI has been removed.

## Flexibility

The data of this resume can be edited in file [data.js](./data.js). All the data is stored in variable `data` and can be used to dynamically generate resume from html template.
